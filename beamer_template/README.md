## Latex Beamer Template

The following files contain my most recent Beamer template. The emphasis is
on having as uncluttered a layout as possible. A liberal dose of light
colors are used throughout the template.

This template is a heavily modified version of the Singapore theme
`beamerthemeSingapore` that is distributed with any Beamer installation.
The progressbar in the theme is designed using ideas from
[StackExchange/TEX](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/59742/progress-bar-for-latex-beamer).
As in the beamer theme, this is released under GNU GPL-2.
